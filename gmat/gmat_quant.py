        "question": "If x and y are positive integers such that x² + y² = 100, what is the greatest possible value of x?",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The greatest perfect square less than 100 is 64 (8²). Testing values: 8² + 6² = 64 + 36 = 100. Therefore, the maximum value of x is 8.",

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Net change calculation: 1.2 (20% increase) × 0.9 (10% discount) = 1.08 → 8% increase from original price.",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Solve the system of equations: From second equation, y = 2x - 5. Substitute into first equation: 3x + 5(2x - 5) = 12 → 13x - 25 = 12 → x = 37/13. Then y = 9/13. x + y = 46/13 ≈ 3.538.",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Triangle inequality theorem: The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So 5 + 12 > x → x < 17, and 5 + x > 12 → x > 7. Only option D (13) satisfies 7 < x < 17.",
