        "question": "Is the integer n divisible by 12?\n(1) n is divisible by 6\n(2) n is divisible by 4",
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "For n to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by both 3 and 4 (prime factors of 12). (1) gives us divisibility by 3 (since 6=2Ã—3) and (2) gives divisibility by 4. Together they're sufficient.",
